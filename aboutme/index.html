    <h2>Dylan Zurita</h2>
    <p>I'm Dylan, I'm 20 years old and I live in Quito-Ecuador, I like to practice sports like volleyball and football, ping pong also. The degree I'm pursuing is web an computer programming. I am not married yet, lucky I guess.</p> Currently I have a part-time job at a pizza place, I have worked there for 3 week now.</p> The thing I love the most about BYU-I is that gave me the opportunity to go for a career, and adapted to my necesities.</p> The advantages I see form learning about careers in web design is that it is simplier for people to work, you can do it online and it facilitates the work, another advantage is that we know that internet will last for a long time and it needs web pages for people around the world, so, we can be sure that a job can be waiting. </p> I've been a member of the church for about 15 years or more I can't remember, I do not have a favorite quote but I have a favorite scripture which is D&C 50:26-27 talks about priesthood and how we can have the authority to have a little of the power of God. </p>
