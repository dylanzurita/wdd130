            <p>If you a like a little or feel some kind of adrenaline, this attraction is perfect for you, The swing of the end of the world, is a 30 meter string swing, is almost at the top of the moutain, and has a spectacular view of Baños, if you need a good photo for you social media here is your chane, professional photographers help you to have a photo in this places
                and it only costs $1, I warn you, the line of waiting can be long.

        <section class="hands">
            <img class="img-act" src="images/manos_de_pachamama.jpeg" alt="manos de la pachamama">
            <p>A peaceful place, for family to enjoy a view, a sacred place to good for your shoes (literally) you need to take your shoes off, before entering, is part of the policy of this place, the line is not too long, and you can take as many picture as you want, it is awesome by night but at day you can see better the view.
                In the same place that this attraction is founded, you can found another extreme activity that is "the fly of the condor", more info about it in my Personal Experience page.
