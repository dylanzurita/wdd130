      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My home page is about letting the user know what is the page and some information about the place I am "promoting", the home page will include three sections, these are: Location, road, and maps.
        The navigation is going to have icons to redirect the people to the site where they want to visit (home, page2, page3, contact us). For the body I am going to present images with a little or some information about what are they seeing, like the province where this city is located, roads and maps about where to go, and where are the attractions or palces they may want to see, even what they need to expect either for the place (Baños) or the website.
        One of the photos for the home page is about where Baños is located in Ecuador, is a map of Ecuador and where direction you will have to got wherever your city is or even if you arrive from other countries to the airport of Quito, you will know wher you need to head or if you chose a tour, then you'll know where the tour is taking you.
        My footer includes, my name, social media icons and links.

      </ul>
      <h3>What to do</h3>
      <p>
        For my second page the main topics are going to be touristic places, and recommendations about restaurants.
        I will include an image of a map that indicates where are the touristic places the user is lookinf for and many other places that are relevant in the place, they can know what routes to take from where they are, or from where their hotel is, they can see is if they need to climb a mountain or if they just can walk to the place.
        Also this second page, will talk about the activities in this places, like water farting or canyoning, hiking, places to eat, what they can eat, and photos about every place, they can see where they would be able to take photos, or attractions the tourist can pay for it and live a good experience, like the "the swing of the end of the world" or "the magic forest", restaurants like cafes or luxurious pizza places, with a whole and fine wine cellar, if the user is interested.
        Places like churches with a semi-gothic style, tour companies that offer you an experience, driving you to wherever you want to go.
        Its also a page for them to start picture how their trip can be, the images will reveal a good part of the place they plan to visit, maybe a gallery of more photos can be an option for this page.

      <h3>Personal experience</h3>
      <p>
        For this page I will include some images of my trip to Baños, as well as some of the attractions that were the most fun for me, and that I recommend, also info and rating about the Hotel I stayes in.
        I will try to include the most of the photos, and some of the places I visit, try to capture even more the user to go and visit this place, this page is about creating an envrionemnt of connecting with the user.
